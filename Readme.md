Data Analysis Project, SS2022 <br>
*Topic 01:* Biomedical Image Analysis <br>
*Group 05:* Cedric Leonhard Marquard, Emily Locke, Melissa Ringeis, Gabriel Tulcan <br>
*Supervisors:* PD Dr. Karl Rohr, Christian Ritter <br>
*Tutor:* Marie Becker


This project's goal was to programm a K-Means image segmentation algorithm from scratch and apply it on coloured as well as grayscale images. The influence of several parameters such as the colour space, the distance metric and different pre-processing methods was analysed.
